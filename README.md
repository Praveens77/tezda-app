           Login
           Register
           List or Dashboard

4.Pattern => MVC (only two screens "registration" and "list")
5.Firebase => For authentication and read write operation
6.centralized coding => color.dart, image.dart,widget.dart

B.Challenges 
1.UI Designing => for making this type of UI which contain all Five features I have to search the figma design and whatever the UI or logo those not present on internet I have to degined on figma and centralized it in image section.

2.APi integration => Because this is a dummy API so it was easy for me to implement it.

3.Firebase => integrating the firebase is a time taking task. authentication and database setup was easy.

Message:- This application is use for "Android app" only. Due to less time and not a proper setup for ios i unable to made it. But I have a faith that if i had planty of time then i can implement it into iOS too.

this is not my best performance, I really feel happy that you give me chance to test my strength and stamina and i feel very happy to share this application.


Thankyou
